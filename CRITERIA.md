Make a 5-minute presentation which convinces us how you have met the following criteria. During your presentation, someone will play your game on the big screen. 


1) Close to usable prototype
2) Collection of scientific data (some may not apply to your project)
   matches one of the proposals
    usable for testing a hypothesis
    sensor usage
    data visualization
`   outputs data for analysis
    potential for future research
3) Subject engagement
    mechanics
    dynamics
    aesthetics
    clarity of goal(s) for player
4) Alignment of scientific and game design goals
1)Conceptually close to the final product, theg ame is however buggy.
2)Data.
Match - 3rd Proposal.
Usabale - It could reveal some interesting results on a controlled environment(players shouldn't see each other).
Sensor - Leap Motion.
Data - Very Bugged.
Output - None.
Potential - The game could reveal some interesting research options if developed further.
3)Subject
Mechanics - Hand sensor, to play connect the dots, and self evaluation of performance.
Dynamics - There is a dynamic between the player and Runes he needs to complete and the with the other player indirectly by affecting the end score based on how they think the other player did in the previous round.  
Aesthetics - 2D and 3D. Traditional Viking Mystical. 
Clarity of Goals - Somewhat clear.
4)We believe the game correctly creates a controlled and engaging environment in which scientists can observe specific player behaviour and analyze data outputed by the game.
